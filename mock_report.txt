pen points:

automatic report:
    Number of Blinks can soon be implemented with pm, is kind of implemented already, but not reported yet

    minimal duration on screen -> will be implemented by me as a next step, by creating an new gazedataframe as discussed with Deborah
    number of fixation per screen /trial -> will be implemented by me as a next step

    comprehension scores: if recorded and if mapping is right
    optical artefact gaze velocity higher than 500 degrees per sec -> indicates eye gaze are not stable, maybe glasses?

    ratio of fixation on AOI, can be implemented with pm, Deborah is working on it


textual feedback:
    how should it look like?
        Feedback in regards to adhering to guidelines?
            calibration/validation process
            obligatory break
            final verdict
            mail to them and multipleye.project@gmail.com

What should happen with the plots?
