# MultiplEYE Sanity Checks

## Correct procedure

1. labs write an email and let us know they are starting the piloting
2. they upload 3 pilots to the correct folder (refer to MultiplEYE data collection guidelines)
3. write an email to let us know they have uploaded the pilots
4. we check the pilots and let them know if they are ok
case a: pilots are ok, start data collection. 
5. case b: require more pilots (redo steps 2-4, just add one or two more pilots, not necessarily 3)
6. UPDATE THIS DOCUMENT!!  https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/7440213456?filePath=%2FMultiplEYE%2FData%20collection%20preparation%2FRegistered%20data%20collections.xlsx


### Reasons to reject pilots straight away
1. data is in the wrong folder
2. missing stimuli/too many stimuli (i.e. did not update according to changelog)
3. missing data (e.g. no data for some participants)



### Reasons to require more pilot data
* not enough validations
* obligatory break not made

### Ask about these things
* extremly many/little calibrations
* very short/long reading time
* strange reading time for one trial
* skimming
*
