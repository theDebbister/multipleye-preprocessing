Dear [Data Collector’s Name],

Thank you for submitting your pilot data and for your careful adherence to the MultiplEYE standardized procedure. 
We have completed the quality check and attached your Data Quality Report to this email. Below, we provide feedback on both strengths and areas for improvement.

We appreciate your commitment to following the MultiplEYE guidelines, and we would like to highlight the following:
- The mandatory break was taken as required.
- Participants read all texts thoroughly, without noticeable skipping or skimming.
- The final validation was conducted before the last stimulus.
- The validation and recalibration protocol was followed correctly, with recalibrations performed when validation exceeded the threshold.
- Optional breaks were taken when tracking quality declined, ensuring better data quality.
- Participants' comprehension question scores were above chance level, suggesting engagement with the task.

These factors contribute to high data quality, and we appreciate your attention to protocol details!

Areas for Improvement 
We also observed some aspects that could be improved:
Gaze stability: [Example: “Some participants showed gaze instability, particularly in later trials. It might help to remind them to maintain a stable position.”]
Text engagement: [Example: “A few instances of skipped or incomplete text reading were detected. Please ensure participants fully engage with the reading material. See attached plots for reference.”]
Recalibration consistency: [Example: “Recalibration was not consistently performed when validation errors increased.”]
Comprehension performance: [Example: "While comprehension question scores were generally above chance, there were fluctuations across participants."]
Practice vs. real trials: While we initially considered distinguishing between these, the difficulty level should remain consistent across both. However, if you notice discrepancies, please let us know.

Please review the attached report for further details and visualizations. If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out. 
If adjustments are needed, we recommend running additional pilot sessions to confirm improvements before proceeding with full data collection.

Thank you again for your valuable contributions to the MultiplEYE project!
